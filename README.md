Static: Static variables and methods are used when a value or method needs to be shared across other classes in an object-oriented programming language. It is essentially a global variable or method that can be accessed directly from the class it is declared in. It is useful when a variable or method needs to be accessible by multiple classes, but not necessarily by all.

Protected: In object-oriented programming, protected is a type of access modifier that allows a class to limit the access of its members to other classes. The protected modifier indicates that the member can only be accessed within the same package as the class or by a subclass of the class. This is useful when you want to limit the access of certain members to only certain classes.

Private: Private is an access modifier used in object-oriented programming to indicate that a member of a class can only be accessed by other members of the same class. This modifier is useful when you want to keep a member variable or method from being accessed by other classes, ensuring that the member can only be accessed and modified by the class it is declared in.
